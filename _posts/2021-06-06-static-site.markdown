# Motivation.
One of the ideas that I had today was to start working on the projects that I always forget to do. Normally I get up early on weekends and if I had a nice sleep suddenly a lot of ideas come to my mind. It can be stuff that I have to fix at work, or solutions that might be of value at some point. But I wasn't taking notes and then ideas go as they came. I end up investigating and doing the stuff I still remember from those moments of "clarity".

But this morning I decided to put an end to that. I created a trello with a kanban template, and started adding items to my own backlog. Now that I had a kanban board, I needed a way to document my projects, with the following requirement:

- Easy to maintain
- No database, nor depepdencies
- Not dynamic
- Free

I wanted something like a README.md, but a litte more featured. I remembered about jekyll, and then read that it was possible to used github pages to serve the static site with a custom domain, https enabled.
